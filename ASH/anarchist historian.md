# **Max Heinrich Hermann Reinhardt Nettlau**

 (German: [[ˈnɛtlaʊ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German); 30 April 1865 – 23 July 1944) was a [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_people) [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist) and [historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian). Although born in [Neuwaldegg](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuwaldegg&action=edit&redlink=1) (today part of [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna)) and raised in Vienna, he lived there until the annexation to [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) in 1938. Max Nettlau retained his [Prussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia) (later German) nationality throughout his life. A student of the [Welsh language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language) he spent time in London where he joined the [Socialist League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_League_(UK,_1885)) and met [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris). While in London he met anarchists such as [Errico Malatesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errico_Malatesta) and [Peter Kropotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin) whom he remained in contact with for the rest of his life. He also helped to found [Freedom Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Press) for whom he wrote for many years.

In the 1890s realising that a generation of socialist and anarchist militants from the mid-19th century was passing away and their archives of writings and correspondence being destroyed, he concentrated his effort and a recent modest inheritance from his father on acquiring and rescuing such collections from destruction. He also made many interviews of veteran militants for posterity. He wrote biographies of many famous anarchists, including [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), [Élisée Reclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lis%C3%A9e_Reclus), and Errico Malatesta. He also wrote a seven volume history of anarchism.

# His extensive collection or archives was sold to the [International Institute of Social History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_of_Social_History) in [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam) in 1935. He lived continuously in Amsterdam from 1938 where he worked on cataloging the archive for the Institute. He died there suddenly from stomach cancer in 1944, without ever being harassed.
