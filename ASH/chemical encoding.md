chemical components - where can i find it - creating my own ash???

keep the percentage !

- *Phosphate 47.5% - baking powder, Fertilizer, glass, fireworks*
- *Calcium 25.3% - shells, chalk, cement*
- *Sulfate (Sulphate) 11.00% - shampoo, body wash, face cleanser, toothpaste (bake)*
- *PotassiumÂ 3.69% - banana,  Fertilizer, fireworks*
- *Sodium 1.12% - table salt, fertilizer, to make glass - paper, to develop*
- *Chloride 1.00% - sea salt as sodium chloride...seaweed, rye, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, olives*
- *Silica 0.9% -sand, gravel, clay, granite or glass, silicon carbide, and silicone*
- *Aluminum Oxide 0.72% - just objects aluminium foil small pieces*
- *Magnesium 0.418% - medicine, for plants too*
- *Iron Oxide 0.118% - magnets, blood*
- *Zinc 0.0342% - batteries, fluorescent lights*
- *Titanium Oxide 0.0260% - paints, rocks*
- *Barium 0.0066% - rat poison, for x ray*
- *Antimony 0.0035% - soils, water, air - not needed in everything*
- *Chromium 0.0018% - brewer's yeast, paint,*
- *Copper 0.0017% - ... objects + poisons*
- *Manganese 0.0013% - medicine, batteries*
- *Lead 0.0008% - batteries, pigments, ammunition, crystal glass*
- *Tin 0.0005% - polish for metals*
- *Vanadium 0.0002% - production comes from magnetite.*
- *Beryllium <0.0001% ?*
- *Mercury <0.00001% - rocks*

find everything somehow the easiest way - the cleanest version and the put it together based on percentage 

observe reactions - make video - different variations? - try to make it very smooth - buy small tools..

> To make human ash I need: *baking powder, chalk, dry toothpaste, dry banana, fertilizer, sea salt, clay, aluminum foil, magnesium pill, drop of blood, inside of batteries, dry paint, rat posion (poison in general), polish for metal*
