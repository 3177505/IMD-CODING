# image manipulation

-taking one image of Nettlau from archive (carries information about his age, the year when it was made, the atmosphere) 

-adding another image which can be connected with him? 

blending images- using pyramids -python????? or something else 

x

or fragment and then rebuild ???

..transcoding the life story who he is from the artefacts what I have found
